<br></br>
## Description
born2beroot is a 42 cursus solo project designed to introduce students to virtual machines and the linux operating system. The project focuses on the use of command line tools (GUI is not allowed), and basic server operation including user and password management, as well as basic security and server management (scheduling using crontab). A VM running either Debian or centOS must be installed using virtual box, and then configured based on a set list of criteria. The student must be able to adequately explain the tools used in this process, including their functionality and significance.

A full description of the project can be found in the [subject](subject/en.subject.pdf) pdf.
